# Computer Vision Projects Repository

This repository contains five projects developed as part of the Computer Vision course. Each project addresses different aspects and techniques related to Computer Vision. Below is a brief description of each project:

## Project 1 - Video Manipulation and Editing with OpenCV

This project provides an overview of the activities carried out in the final assignment of the Computer Vision course. The main objective was to conduct experiments in video manipulation and editing using the OpenCV library in Python. The project allowed the practical application of the Computer Vision concepts learned during the course.

## Project 2 - Object Localization in Images

This report describes the activities carried out in the third Computer Vision project. The focus of this project was to develop an algorithm for object localization in images, using the algorithm proposed by Swain and Ballard. The project involved the practical application of image processing techniques and pattern recognition.

## Project 3 - Flower Classification

In this project, we present an overview of the activities conducted in the fourth Computer Vision project. The primary task was to perform classification experiments using a widely known dataset containing information about the length and width of sepals and petals of three categories of flowers. The project demonstrated the application of machine learning techniques in Computer Vision tasks.

## Project 4 - Webcam Calibration

This report describes the activities carried out in the second Computer Vision project. The central objective was to achieve the calibration of a low-quality webcam camera. The project involved correcting geometric distortions and improving the quality of images captured by the webcam.

## Project 5 - Image Filters and Manipulation

In this initial Computer Vision project, we provide an overview of the activities conducted. The main goal was the practical application of concepts learned in class, with a focus on image filters and manipulation. Exercises were conducted to explore image transformation through filtering operations.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to one of the projects listed above and contains the source code, data, and resources related to the specific project. Feel free to explore each folder individually for more details about the projects and their outcomes.
